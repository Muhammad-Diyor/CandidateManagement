# Candidate Management API

A lightweight .NET 8 Web API for managing job candidate information.  
---

## üöÄ What It Does

- Accepts candidate data via a single API endpoint
- Uses **email** as the unique identifier
- If the candidate exists ‚Üí updates them  
  If not ‚Üí creates a new one
- Supports **partial updates** (only send what you want to change)
- Validates inputs (like time formats)
- Saves data to SQLite DB
- Caches candidates in memory for performance (Caches the updated/added entity, because it has higher probability of being changed in following 10 minutes)

## Why I Built It Like This

I tried to keep things clean and scalable. Here's the thinking behind the architecture and decisions:

### üîπ Clean Architecture

I structured it into layers:
- **API** ‚Äì presentation & middleware
- **Application** ‚Äì interfaces, DTOs, services
- **Domain** ‚Äì core entities
- **Infrastructure** ‚Äì EF Core, caching, repositories
- **Tests** ‚Äì xUnit + Moq

This makes it easy to test, replace things (like the DB or caching, experienced in my case), and grow over time.

---

### üîπ Database: Why SQLite?

I actually started with **PostgreSQL**, but realized that for a recruiter or teammate to run the project easily, asking them to set up Postgres isn‚Äôt great.  
So I switched to **SQLite**, which:
- Works anywhere
- Requires no setup
- Just press "Run" in Visual Studio and it works

Migrations are applied automatically on app start.

### üîπ Caching: First Redis, Then In-Memory

Initially I used **Redis** for caching recently used candidates (to avoid DB hits on repeat updates, and read the repeatedly requested candidates faster).  
That worked great ‚Äî but Redis requires Docker or external setup.

To meet the task‚Äôs **‚Äújust run the app‚Äù** requirement, I, at the end, swapped it for **.NET‚Äôs built-in in-memory cache**.

And Clean Architecture came handy there ‚Äî I didn‚Äôt have to touch anything except one line in `Program.cs` and a class file.  
Everything else stayed the same.

## üì¶ Tech Stack

- .NET 8
- SQLite via Entity Framework Core
- In-Memory Caching (IMemoryCache)
- Clean Architecture
- FluentValidation
- xUnit + Moq

---

## üõ† How to Run

> No setup, no Docker, no external DB ‚Äî just run it.

- Clone the the repository into your device;
- Open it in Visual Studio and hit the run button;
- Or just type `dotnet run` in terminal;


<br>

## üí¨ Assumptions Made
- No auth needed (not in requirements)

- One endpoint only ‚Äî extendable in future

- Used caching for ‚Äúrecently created or updated‚Äù candidates to avoid repeated DB hits

- SQLite and in-memory caching used for 100% self-contained project

- Partial update logic prioritizes readability and simplicity

# Future Improvements

These are things I would improve or implement if I had more time, or if this project were going into production.

---

## 1. Better Exception Handling

Currently:
- We have a global exception middleware that returns a generic 500 error for unhandled exceptions.

Improvements:
- Introduce custom exception types (e.g., `ValidationException`, `NotFoundException`, etc.)
- Catch and return proper status codes (e.g., 400, 404)
- Wrap all responses with a consistent format (e.g., `{ statusCode, message, errors }`)
- Add logging categories + correlation IDs for traceability

---

## 2. Add Authentication/Authorization

Currently:
- No auth is implemented, since the task didn‚Äôt request it.

If needed:
- Add basic JWT token authentication
- Add role-based access (e.g., Admin can write, User can only view)

---

# 3. Add Integration Tests

Currently:
- All logic is unit-tested (service + repo), but we don‚Äôt test the full request pipeline.

Improvements:
- Use WebApplicationFactory to test full API endpoint behavior
- Assert actual HTTP status codes, DB writes, and validation responses

---

## 4. Add CI/CD Pipeline

Currently:
- Tests must be run manually.

Improvements:
- Add GitHub Actions to run tests on every push/PR

---

## 6. Redis Support (Prod-Ready Caching)

Currently:
- We swapped Redis out for in-memory cache to keep the project self-contained.

In production:
- Bring back Redis (already supported via `ICacheService`)
- Configure expiration policies (sliding vs absolute)
- Use it across other services too (e.g., lookup tables, rate-limiting, auth tokens)

---

## 6. General Refactors & Polish

- Add proper logging (structured logs via Serilog)
- Others

---

## 8. Improve Partial Update Logic

Right now:
- Partial update is handled manually with null/empty checks.

Could be improved by:
- Supporting PATCH with JSON Merge Patch or JSON Patch
- Using a dynamic update DTO pattern with optional fields
